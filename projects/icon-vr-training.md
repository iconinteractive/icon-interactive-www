brief: "<p>Leverage virtual reality (VR) to provide local university students with
  real-world hands-on training opportunities via immersive technology, all within
  a framework that allows the university to recoup large parts of capital outlay.</p>"
solution_label: Solution
solution: <p>ICON is building a VR training platform whereby students involved in
  high stress procedures can practice and apply required knowledge and skills in a
  low stakes environment. <br><br>Organizations can speed up the learning process
  by creating virtual environments that are representative of actual workplaces without
  the costs of deploying students to a physical space. AR/VR training simulations
  can be far more cost effective and can minimize potentially life threatening mistakes,
  all while promoting learning through discovery and experience.<br><br>At one ICON
  university client, students are using VR training to simulate emergent healthcare
  scenarios and crime scene investigations, logging critical hours “doing” the work
  of professionals in the field.<br><br>A true win/win for students and colleges that's
  literally changing the landscape of professional learning.</p><p>For more info,
