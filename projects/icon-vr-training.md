brief_label: Challenge
brief: "<p>Leverage virtual reality (VR) to provide Concordia University students
  with real-world hands-on training opportunities via immersive technology, all within
  a framework that allows the university to recoup large parts of capital outlay.</p>"
solution_label: Solution
solution: "<p>ICON is building a VR training platform whereby students involved in
  high stress procedures can practice and apply required knowledge and skills in a
  low stakes environment. <br><br>Organizations can speed up the learning process
  by creating virtual environments that are representative of actual workplaces without
  the costs of deploying students to a physical space. AR/VR training simulations
  can be far more cost effective and can minimize costly and potentially life threatening
  mistakes, all while promoting learning through discovery and experience.<br><br>At
  Concordia, students are using VR training to simulate emergent healthcare scenarios
  and crime scene investigations, logging critical hours “doing” the work of professionals
  in the field.<br><br>A true win/win for students and colleges that's literally changing
  the landscape of professional learning.</p>"
