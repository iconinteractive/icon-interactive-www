title: CES 2020 - Happening Now

CES 2020 is happening right now in Las Vegas!

Xperi selected ICON to create all screen-based animations for their CES booth.

Xperi's booth presence  needed to express the sophistication and state of the art technology of its products and partnerships across all platforms.

ICON created nine different animations highlighting their partners to play across all booth screens, including a waterfall at the center of the booth. We also created a booth takeover for IMAX®, which will play across all screens simultaneously.

We thank all our partners at Xperi and we are looking forward to next year 2021!
